Hi Movie Maker Money Maker (MMMM),

Thank you for reaching out with your query regarding how to make revenue through making movies. 

I believe I can find out what metrics (features) that can best determine how to make the most revenue from a movie. I have a good hunch that there are some linear relationships between certain movie features and how much revenue can be generated. 

Looking at public data from boxofficemojo.com and imdb.com I can scrape off the necessary data to be able to predict what features will generate the most amount of revenue. Using tools such as BeautifulSoup and Selenium should make requiring this data a breeze. 

Some of the  features that I plan to compare include, but are not limited to: budget, run-time, top actors, directors, and when it was released. 

I will take over 1000+ movies that have been released and run some regression tests to find what features are most positively, and negatively correlated to making a block buster hit!

Kind regards,

Mitchell C. Seiter
