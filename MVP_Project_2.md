Hi Client Movie Maker Money Maker (MMMM),

I wanted to write to update you on the progress that has been made since our correspondence last week. 

First the bad news. I regret to inform you that gathering a lot of the data has been more time intensive than we originally thought it would take. I was hoping to have some sample regressions ready today to be able to present to you, but at the moment they are not ready. 

On to some better news. The gathering of the data is fully automated with the click of one button. I was able to build our dataframe with one click using Selenium and then 1000 different movie titles with all of their various features are added! 

A snippet of this dataframe has been added below. 

I would like to conclude by saying that we are still on track to have all deliverables by this Friday. I will need to convert a few of our categorical features, such as MPAA and Genres, to numerical categories so they are ready for use, and will be able to build our models from there. 

I would like to apologize for not having those sample regressions today, but would like to assure you that everything will be delivered on Friday as promised. 

If you have any questions or concerns please do not hesitate to reach out. 

Kind regards,
Mitchell
